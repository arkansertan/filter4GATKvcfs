# filter4GATKvcfs

What is  filter4GATKvcf ?

filter4GATKvcf is R-Shiny based an exome variant analysis toolbox. Current software (ie; Excel, OpenOffice, etc.) remains insufficient to analyse large-scale exome sequencing data. Therefore, filter4GATKvcf provides users with various filtering options;

1) Quality parameters
2) GC ratio
3) Gene name
4) GATK based POLYPHEN and SIFT scores
