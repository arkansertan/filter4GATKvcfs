What is  filter4GATKvcf ?

filter4GATKvcf is R-Shiny based an exome variant analysis toolbox. Current softwares (ie; Excel, OpenOffice, etc.) remain insufficient to analyse large-scale exome sequencing data. Therefore, filter4GATKvcf provides users with various filtering options;

1) Genotype
2) Gene Symbols
3) Impact
4) Genotyping Quality (GQ)
5) Reading Depth (DP)
6) Allel Frequency (AF)
7) Quality
8) GC content
9) Mapping Quality (MAP QUAL)
